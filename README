NTLM Authentication Scheme
==========================

This module implements the NTLM authentication mechanism.  It can be
used to perform NTLM style authentication for any desired protocol.

The module works well with the Mail::IMAPClient module in the
"authenticate" method, however I had to make a change to that method
for it to work.  The following line (2511 in version 2.1.4):

			($code) = $o->[DATA] =~ /^\+ (.*)$/ ;

needed to be changed to:

			($code) = $o->[DATA] =~ /^\+(.*)$/ ;

as the initial NTLM challenge is empty.
