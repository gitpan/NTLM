NTLM Authentication Scheme
==========================

This module implements the NTLM authentication mechanism.  It can be
used to perform NTLM style authentication for any desired protocol.

The module works well with the Mail::IMAPClient module in the
"authenticate" method, however I had to make a change to that method
for it to work.  The following line (2511 in version 2.1.4):

			($code) = $o->[DATA] =~ /^\+ (.*)$/ ;

needed to be changed to:

			($code) = $o->[DATA] =~ /^\+(.*)$/ ;

as the initial NTLM challenge is empty.

This module also works well with LWP::Authen::Ntlm , allowing LWP::UserAgent 
and/or WWW::Mechanise to automate/browse/fetch/etc remote Microsoft Windows 
servers running NTLM authentication. 
Example use is like this(note the fact that NTLM.pm is NOT explicitly used!):

    use WWW::Mechanize;
    $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new(keep_alive=>1);
    $mech->no_proxy('my.server'); 
    $mech->credentials('my.server:80', '', "my_domain\\my_user", my_pass);
    $response = $mech->get( $url  );
